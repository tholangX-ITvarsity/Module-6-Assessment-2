                <h2>Welcome To Auto4Sale</h2>
                <p>THE LARGEST AUTOMOTIVE MARKETPLACE</p>
                <p>Auto4Sale has the largest automotive marketplace in South Africa and gets over 11 million visits each month to its online platforms. With car shoppers conducting over 55 million searches across more than 130 000 listings on mobile, tablet, desktop devices and apps.</p>
                <p>Auto4Sale uses state-of-the-art technology to bring motor vehicle buyers and sellers together. In addition, it was the first in its category in South Africa to introduce variant-level keyword search, enabling shoppers to simply type in what they are looking for. World class iOS and Android applications mean car shoppers can car shop anywhere, anytime.</p>
                <p>Thousands of private advertisers have sold their vehicles on Auto4Sale. And with a focus on solving for pain points in the car buying journey, in 2018 Auto4Sale introduced a managed process called “We Sell” - for people seeking a hassle-free car sale process. In addition, Auto4Sale recently launched a free service that enables sellers to connect directly to Auto4Sale’s trusted dealer network, receiving the best possible cash offer.</p>
                <p>Auto4Sale has created tools for dealers to track online performance. And as the market leader, Auto4Sale leveraged the large amounts of data in possession to create Fuzion - revolutionary software designed to use up to the minute demand and supply trends to help dealers make better pricing and stocking decisions.</p>
